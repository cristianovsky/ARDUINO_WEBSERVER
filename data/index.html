            <p>End of passion play
                Crumbling away
                I'm your source of self-destruction
                Veins that pump with fear
                Sucking darkest clear
                Leading on your death's construction
                
                Taste me, you will see
                More is all you need
                Dedicated to
                How I'm killing you
                
                Come crawling faster (faster)
                Obey your master (master)
                Your life burns faster (faster)
                Obey your master, master
                
                Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
                Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
                Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
                Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
                
                Master, master
                Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
                Master, master
                
                Needlework the way
                Never you betray
                Life of death becoming clearer
                Pain monopoly
                Ritual misery
                Chop your breakfast on a mirror
                
                Taste me, you will see
                More is all you need
                Dedicated to
                How I'm killing you
                
                Come crawling faster (faster)
                Obey your master (master)
                Your life burns faster (faster)
                Obey your master, master
                
                Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
                Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
                Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
                Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
                
                Master, master
                Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
                Master, master
                
                (Master, master, master, master)
                
                Master, master
                Where's the dreams that I've been after?
                Master, master
                You promised only lies
                
                Laughter, laughter
                All I hear or see is laughter
                Laughter, laughter
                Laughing at my cries
                
                Fix me!
                
                Hell is worth all that
                Natural habitat
                Just a rhyme without a reason
                Never-ending maze
                Drift on numbered days
                Now your life is out of season
                
                I will occupy
                I will help you die
                I will run through you
                Now I rule you too
                
                Come crawling faster (faster)
                Obey your master (master)
                Your life burns faster (faster)
                Obey your master, master
                
                Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
                Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
                Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
                Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
                
                Master, master
                Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
                Master, master...
